/**
 * Developers implement MessageHandlers in order to receive incoming messages
 * during a web socket conversation. 
 * Each web socket session uses no more than one thread at a time to call its MessageHandlers. This means
 * that, provided each message handler instance is used to handle messages for one web socket session, at most 
 * one thread at a time can be calling any of its methods. Developers who wish to handle messages from multiple
 * clients within the same message handlers may do so by adding the same instance as a handler on each of the Session
 * objects for the clients. In that case, they will need to code with the possibility of their MessageHandler 
 * being called concurrently by multiple threads, each one arising from a different client session.
